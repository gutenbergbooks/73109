 POET</h2>


<img class="drop-cap" src="images/image-iii-b.jpg" alt="(Stylized M)">
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Michelangelo</span>, who considered
himself as primarily sculptor,
afterwards painter, disclaimed
the character of poet
by profession. He was nevertheless
prolific in verse; the
pieces which survive, in number more than two
hundred, probably represent only a small part
of his activity in this direction. These compositions
are not to be considered merely as
the amusement of leisure, the byplay of fancy;
they represent continued meditation, frequent
reworking, careful balancing of words; he
worked on a sonnet or a madrigal in the same
manner as on a statue, conceived with ardent
imagination, undertaken with creative energy,
pursued under the pressure of a superabundance
of ideas, occasionally abandoned in dissatisfaction,
but at other times elaborated to that final
excellence which exceeds as well as includes
all merits of the sketch, and, as he himself said,<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
constitutes a rebirth of the idea into the realm
of eternity. In the sculptor’s time, the custom
of literary society allowed and encouraged interchange
of verses. If the repute of the
writer or the attraction of the rhymes commanded
interest, these might be copied, reach
an expanding circle, and achieve celebrity. In
such manner, partly through the agency of
Michelangelo himself, the sonnets of Vittoria
Colonna came into circulation, and obtained
an acceptance ending in a printed edition. But
the artist did not thus arrange his own rhymes,
does not appear even to have kept copies; written
on stray leaves, included in letters, they
remained as loose memoranda, or were suffered
altogether to disappear. The fame of the author
secured attention for anything to which he
chose to set his hand; the verses were copied
and collected, and even gathered into the form
of books; one such manuscript gleaning he
revised with his own hand. The sonnets became
known, the songs were set to music, and
the recognition of their merit induced a contemporary
author, in the seventy-first year of
the poet’s life, to deliver before the Florentine
Academy a lecture on a single sonnet.</p>

<p>Diffusion through the printing-press, however,<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_v">[v]</span>
the poems did not attain. Not until
sixty years after the death of their author did
a grand-nephew, also called Michelangelo
Buonarroti, edit the verse of his kinsman; in
this task he had regard to supposed literary proprieties,
conventionalizing the language and
sentiment of lines which seemed harsh or impolite,
supplying endings for incomplete compositions,
and in general doing his best to deprive
the verse of an originality which the age
was not inclined to tolerate. The recast was
accepted as authentic, and in this mutilated
form the poetry remained accessible. Fortunately
the originals survived, partly in the
handwriting of the author, and in 1863 were
edited by Guasti. The publication added to
the repute of the compositions, and the sonnets
especially have become endeared to many English
readers.</p>

<p>The long neglect of Michelangelo’s poetry
was owing to the intellectual deficiencies of
the succeeding generation. In spite of the
partial approbation of his contemporaries, it
is likely that these were not much more appreciative,
and that their approval was rendered
rather to the fame of the maker than to
the merits of the work. The complication of<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
the thought, frequently requiring to be thought
out word for word, demanded a mental effort
beyond the capacity of literati whose ideal was
the simplicity and triviality of Petrarchian
imitators. Varchi assuredly had no genuine
comprehension of the sonnet to which he devoted
three hours of his auditors’ patience;
Berni, who affirmed that Michelangelo wrote
things, while other authors used words, to
judge by his own compositions could scarce
have been more sensible of the artist’s emotional
depth. The sculptor, who bitterly expressed
his consciousness that for the highest
elements of his genius his world had no eyes,
must have felt a similar lack of sympathy with
his poetical conceptions. Here he stood on
less safe ground; unacquainted with classic
literature, unable correctly to write a Latin
phrase, he must have known, to use his own
metaphor, that while he himself might value
plain homespun, the multitude admired the
stuffs of silk and gold that went to the making
of a tailors’ man. It is likely that the resulting
intellectual loneliness assumed the form of
modesty, and that Michelangelo took small
pains to preserve his poetry because he set on
it no great value.</p>

<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span></p>

<p>The verse, essentially lyric, owed its inspiration
to experience. A complete record
would have constituted a biography more intimate
than any other. But such memorial
does not exist; of early productions few survive;
the extant poems, for the most part, appear
to have been composed after the sixtieth
year of their author.</p>

<p>The series begins with a sonnet written in
1506, when Michelangelo was thirty-one years
of age. The sculptor had been called to
Rome by pope Julius, who conceived that the
only way to ensure an adequately magnificent
mausoleum was to prepare it during his own
lifetime. A splendid design was made for the
monument destined to prove the embarrassment
of Michelangelo’s career; but the pope
was persuaded that it was not worth while to
waste his means in marbles, and in the spring
of 1506 the artist fled to Florence. In that
city he may have penned the sonnet in which
Julius is blamed for giving ear to the voice of
Echo (misreporting calumniators) instead of
holding the balance even and the sword erect
(in the character of a sculptured Justice). The
writer adds a bitter complaint of the injustice
of fate, which sends merit to pluck the fruit<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
of a withered bough. Another sonnet of the
period seems to have been written in Rome;
the subscription reads: “Your Michelangelo,
in Turkey.” The piece contains an indictment
against the papal court, at that time occupied
with plans for military advancement,
where the eucharistic cup is changed into helmet,
and cross into lance; for safety’s sake,
let Christ keep aloof from a city where his
blood would be sold dropwise. Work there
is none, and the Medusa-like pope turns the
artist to stone; if poverty is beloved by heaven,
the servants of heaven, under the opposite
banner, are doing their best to destroy that
other life. In 1509, a sonnet addressed to
Giovanni of Pistoia describes the sufferings
endured in executing the frescoes of the Sistine
chapel. We are shown Michelangelo
bent double on his platform, the paint oozing
on his face, his eyes blurred and squinting, his
fancy occupied with conjecture of the effect
produced on spectators standing below. Allusion
is made to hostile critics; the writer
bids his friend maintain the honor of one who
does not profess to be a painter. While looking
upward to the vault retained in the memory
of many persons as the most holy spot in<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
Europe, it is well to recollect the sufferings
of the artist, who in an unaccustomed field of
labor achieved a triumph such as no other
decorator has obtained. A fourth sonnet, addressed
to the same Giovanni, reveals the flaming
irritability of a temper prone to exaggerate
slights, especially from a Pistoian, presumably
insensible to the preëminence of Florence,
“that precious joy.”</p>

<p>With this group can be certainly classed
only one sonnet of a different character (No.
XX). This was penned on a letter of December,
1507, addressed to Michelangelo at
Bologna, where he was then leading a miserable
life, engaged on the statue of Julius; this
work, on which he wasted three years, was
finally melted into a cannon, in order that the
enemies of the pope might fire at the latter by
means of his own likeness. The verse is a
spontaneous and passionate outburst of admiration
for a beautiful girl. With this piece might
be associated two or three undated compositions
of similar nature, which serve to show
the error of the supposition that the artist was
insensible to feminine attractions. It may be
affirmed that the reverse was the case, and
that the thoughtful temper of the extant poetry<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
is due solely to the sobering influences of
time.</p>

<p>The verse which might have exhibited the
transition from early to later manhood has not
been preserved; during twenty years survive
no compositions of which the date is assured.
Subsequently to that time, assistance is derived
from the fortunate accident that several of the
sonnets were written on dated letters. It is
true that this indication is far from furnishing
secure testimony. Even at the present day,
when paper is so easily obtained, I have known
a writer of rhyme who was in the habit of
using the backs of old letters. That Michelangelo
sometimes did the same thing appears
to be demonstrated by the existence of a sonnet
(No. L), which, though written on the
back of a letter of 1532, professes to be composed
in extreme old age. The evidence,
therefore, is of value only when supported by
the character of the piece. Nor is internal
testimony entirely to be depended on. It is
to be remembered that all makers of verse remodel
former work, complete imperfect essays,
put into form reminiscences which essentially
belong to an earlier stage of feeling. Attempts
to classify the productions must follow a subjective<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
opinion, very apt to err. Nevertheless
something may be accomplished in this direction.</p>

<p>The nephew states that two sonnets (Nos.
XXIV and XXV) were found on a leaf containing
a memorandum of 1529. Extant is
another sonnet, certainly written on a page
having an entry of that year. These three
sonnets seem to breathe the same atmosphere;
the emotion is sustained by a direct impulse,
the verse is apparently inspired by a sentiment
too lyric to be unhappy; the employment of
theologic metaphor and Platonic fancy is still
subsidiary to emotion. Allowing for the imaginative
indulgence of feeling common to
lyrical poets, it seems nevertheless possible to
perceive a basis of personal experience. With
these pieces may be associated a number of
sonnets and madrigals, among the most beautiful
productions of the author, which may
conjecturally be assigned to the period before
his permanent Roman residence, or at any rate
may be supposed to represent the impressions
of such time. As compared with the work
which may with confidence be dated as produced
within the ensuing decade, these correspond
to an earlier manner. Wanting the<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
direct and impetuous passion of the few youthful
verses, they nevertheless show a spiritual
conception of sexual attachment, not yet resolved
into religious aspiration. They suggest
that the inflammable and gentle-hearted
artist passed through a series of inclinations,
none of which terminated in a permanent
alliance.</p>

<p>At the end of 1534, near his sixtieth year,
Michelangelo came to live in Rome; and to
that city, three years later, Vittoria Colonna
came for a long visit, in the twelfth year
of her widowhood, and the forty-seventh of
her life. An acquaintance may have been
established in the course of previous years,
when the lady visited Rome, or possibly even
at a prior time. Whatever was the date of
the first encounter, allusions in the poems seem
to imply that the meeting produced a deep impression
on the mind of the artist (Madrigals
LIV, LXXII). At all events, the relations
of the two grew into a friendship, hardly to
be termed intimacy. Only a very few of the
poems are known to have been addressed to
Vittoria; but the veiled references of several
pieces, and the tone of the poetry, appear to
justify the opinion that admiration for this<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
friend was the important influence that affected
the character of the verse written during
the ten years before her death in 1547.</p>

<p>In Rome, the Marchioness of Pescara made
her home in the convent of San Silvestro, where
she reigned as queen of an intelligent circle.
A charming and welcome glimpse of this society
is furnished by Francis of Holland, who
professes to relate three conversations, held
on as many Sunday mornings, in which the
sculptor took a chief part. It is not difficult
to imagine the calmness and coolness of
the place, the serious and placid beauty of the
celebrated lady, the figure of Michelangelo, the
innocent devices by which the sympathetic Vittoria
contrived to educe his vehement outbursts
on artistic questions, the devout listening of the
stranger, hanging on the chief artist of Italy
with the attention of a reporter who means to
put all into a book. So far as the conversation
represents a symposium on matters of art,
no doubt the account is to be taken as in good
measure the method adopted by Francis to put
before the world his own ideas; but among the
remarks are many so consonant to the character
of the sculptor that it is impossible to
doubt the essential correctness of the narration.<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
In the language of Michelangelo speaks haughty
reserve, the consciousness of superiority, accompanied
by a sense that his most precious
qualities exceeded the comprehension of a
world which rendered credit less to the real
man than to the fashionable artist, and whose
attention expressed not so much gratitude for
illumination as desire of becoming associated
with what society held in respect.</p>

<p>All students who have had occasion to concern
themselves with the biography of Vittoria
Colonna have become impressed with the excellence
of her character. After the loss of a
husband to whom she had been united in extreme
youth, she declared her intention of forming
no new ties; and it must have been an
exceptional purity which the censorious and
corrupt world could associate with no breath of
scandal. She had been accounted the most
beautiful woman in Italy, of that golden-haired
and broadbrowed type recognized as favorite;
but her intelligence, rather than personal attractions
or social position, had made her seclusion
in Ischia a place of pilgrimage for men of letters.
The attraction she possessed for the lonely,
reserved, and proud artist is a testimony that
to her belonged especially the inexplicable attraction<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>
of a sympathetic nature. Such disposition
is a sufficient explanation of her devotion
to the memory of a husband who appears to have
been essentially a <i lang="it">condottiere</i> of the time, a soldier
who made personal interest his chief consideration.
She may also be credited with a
sound judgment and pure ethical purpose in the
practical affairs of life.</p>

<p>Yet to allow that Vittoria Colonna was good
and lovable does not make it necessary to worship
her as a tenth muse, according to the
partial judgment of her contemporaries. Unfortunately,
time has spared her verses, respecting
which may be repeated advice bestowed
by Mrs. Browning in regard to another female
author, by no means to indulge in the perusal,
inasmuch as they seem to disprove the presence
of a talent which she nevertheless probably possessed.
In the case commented on by the
modern writer, the genius absent in the books
is revealed in the correspondence; but epistolary
composition was not the forte of the Marchioness
of Pescara, whose communications,
regarded as pabulum for a hungry heart, are as
jejune as can be conceived. Neither is she to
be credited with originality in her attitude
toward political or religious problems. It does<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
not appear that she quarreled with the principles
of the polite banditti of her own family;
nor was she able to attain even an elementary
notion of Italian patriotism. She has been set
down as a reformer in religion; but such tendency
went no further than a sincere affection
toward the person of the founder of Christianity,
a piety in no way inconsistent with ritual
devotion. When it came to the dividing of
the ways, she had no thought other than to
follow the beaten track. Nor in the world of
ideas did she possess greater independence;
with all her esteem for Michelangelo as artist
and man, it is not likely that she was able to
estimate the sources of his supremacy, any
more than to foresee a time when her name
would have interest for the world only as associated
with that of the sculptor. It may be
believed that a mind capable of taking pleasure
in the commonplaces of her rhyme could never
have appreciated the essential merits of the
mystic verse which she inspired. Here, also,
Michelangelo was destined to remain uncomprehended.
Vittoria presented him with her
own poems, neatly written out and bound, but
never seems to have taken the pains to gather
those of the artist. Intellectually, therefore,<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span>
her limitations were many; but she was endowed
with qualities more attractive, a gentle
sympathy, a noble kindness, a person and expression
representative of that ideal excellence
which the sculptor could appreciate only as
embodied in human form.</p>

<p>While earlier writers of biography were inclined
to exaggerate the effect on Michelangelo
of his acquaintance with Vittoria Colonna,
later authors, as I think, have fallen into the
opposite error. To Vittoria, indeed, whose
thoughts, when not taken up with devotional
exercises, were occupied with the affairs of
her family or of the church, such amity could
occupy only a subordinate place. One of her
letters to Michelangelo may be taken as a polite
repression of excessive interest. But on
the other side, the poetry of the artist is a clear,
almost a painful expression of his own state
of mind. We are shown, in the mirror of his
own verse, a sensitive, self-contained, solitary
nature, aware that he is out of place in a world
for which he lacks essential graces and in which
he is respected for his least worthy qualities.
That under such circumstances he should value
the kindness of the only woman with whom he
could intelligently converse, that he should<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</span>
feel the attraction of eyes from which seemed
to descend starry influences, that he should suffer
from the sense of inadequacy and transitoriness,
from the difference of fortune and the
lapse of years, the contrasts of imagination and
possibility, was only, as he would have said,
to manifest attribute in act, to suffer the natural
pain incident to sensitive character.</p>

<p>In the most striking of the compositions devoted
to the memory of Vittoria Colonna
Michelangelo speaks of her influence as the
tool by which his own genius had been formed,
and which, when removed to heaven and made
identical with the divine archetype, left no
earthly substitute. That the language was no
more than an expression of the fact is shown
by the alteration which from this time appears
in his verse. Poetry passes over into piety;
artistic color is exchanged for the monotone of
religious emotion. One may be glad that the
old age, of whose trials he has left a terrible picture,
found its support and alleviation; yet the
later poems, distressing in their solemnity, pietistic
in their self-depreciation, exhibit a declining
poetic faculty, and in this respect are not
to be ranked with their forerunners.</p>

<p>The verse of Michelangelo has been lauded<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xix">[xix]</span>
as philosophic. The epithet is out of place;
if by philosophy be meant metaphysics, there
is no such thing as philosophic poetry. Poetry
owes no debt to metaphysical speculation, can
coexist as well with one type of doctrine as
with another. The obligation is on the other
side; philosophy is petrified poetry, which no
infusion of adventitious sap can relegate to
vital function. Like all other developments
of life, philosophic theories can be employed
by poets only for colors of the palette. If
Platonic conceptions be deemed exceptional, it
is because such opinions are themselves poetry
more than metaphysics, and constitute rather
metaphorical expressions for certain human
sentiments than any system of ratiocination.
For the purposes of Michelangelo, these doctrines
supplied an adequate means of presentation,
quite independent of the abstract verity
of the principles considered as the product of
reasoning.</p>

<p>With the sculptor, it was the impressions
and feelings of later life that this philosophy
served to convey. The few remains of comparative
youth lead us to suppose that in the verse
of this time the reflective quality was subordinate;
the productions of later manhood breathe<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xx">[xx]</span>
a gentle emotion, which, allowing for contrasts,
may be compared with that animating the
poetry of Wordsworth; only in compositions
belonging to incipient age do we find a full
development of Platonic conceptions; these,
again, constitute a step in the progress toward
that Christian quietism into which the stream
of the poet’s genius emerges, as from its impetuous
source, through the powerful flow of its
broadening current, a great river at last empties
itself into the all-encompassing sea.</p>

<p>This philosophy was no result of reading,
but a deposit from conversations which the
youth had overheard in the Medicean gardens,
where he may have listened to the eloquence
of Marsilio Ficino. When the time came,
these reminiscences were able to influence imagination
and color fancy. For a commentary
on Michelangelo, one has no need to go to the
Phaedrus or Symposium; the verse, like all
true poetry, is self-illuminative. That God
is the archetype and fountain-head of all excellency,
that external objects suggest the perfection
they do not include, that objects of nature,
reflected in the mirror of the intelligence, move
the soul to perform the creative act by which
outward beauty is reborn into her own likeness,<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</span>
and loved as the representation of her own
divinity, that the highest property of external
things is to cause human thought to transcend
from the partial to the universal,—these are
conceptions so simple and natural that no
course of study is necessary to their appreciation.
The ideas are received as symbols of
certain moral conditions, and so far not open
to debate. Only when the attempt is made to
generalize, to set them up as the sum of all experience,
do they become doubtful; the principles
are better comprehended without the
dialectic, and indeed it frequently happens that
he who has paid most attention to the latter is
least informed respecting the true significance
of the imaginations for the sake of which the
argument professes to exist.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with this Hellenic, one might
say human mysticism, went the Christian mysticism
expressed in the poetry of Dante. In
place of the serene archetype, the apotheosis
of reason, we are presented with the archetypal
love, reaching out toward mankind through
the forms of nature. No longer the calm friend,
the beloved person is conceived as the ardent
angel, messenger from the empyrean, descending
and revealing. It has been held that these<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</span>
two forms of thought are irreconcilable; I
should consider them as complementary. Before
the beginnings of the Christian church had
been effected a union of Platonic imagination
with Hebrew piety; Christian sentiment expresses
in terms of affection the philosophic
doctrine, also pious and poetic, however proclaimed
under the name and with the coloring
of sober reason.</p>

<p>It could not have been expected that in the
poetical activity which of necessity with him
remained a subordinate interest, Michelangelo
should have manifested the full measure of that
independent force, which in two arts had proved
adequate to break new channels. This third
method of expression served to manifest a part
of his nature for which grander tasks did not
supply adequate outlets; the verse accordingly
reveals new aspects of character. It was for
gentle, wistful, meditative emotions that the
artist found it necessary to use rhyme. If not
torrential, the current was vital; no line unfreshened
by living waters. This function explains
the limitation of scope; essays in pastoral,
in <i lang="it">terza rima</i>, served to prove that here did
not lie his path; in the conventional forms of
the sonnet and the madrigal he found the<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</span>
medium desired. The familiarity of the form
did not prevent originality of substance; he
had from youth been intimate with the youthful
melodies of Dante, the lucid sonnets of
Petrarch; but his own style, controlled by
thought, is remote from the gentle music of the
one, the clear flow of the other. The verse
exhibits a superabundance of ideas, not easily
brought within the limits of the rhyme; amid
an imagery prevailingly tender and reflective,
now and then a gleam or a flash reveals the
painter of the Sistine and the sculptor of the
Medicean chapel.</p>

<p>Essentially individual is the artistic imagery.
As Michelangelo was above all a creator whose
genius inclined him toward presentation of the
unadorned human form, so his metaphors are
prevailingly taken from the art of sculpture, a
loan which enriches the verse by the association
with immortal works. These comparisons,
taken from the methods of the time, are not altogether
such as could now be employed. At
the outset, indeed, the procedure scarcely differed;
with the sculptor of the Renaissance, the
first step was to produce a sketch of small dimensions;
the same thing is done by the modern
artist, who commonly uses clay and plaster<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</span>
in place of wax. It is in the nature of the design,
or, as Michelangelo said, of the “model,”
that, as having the character of an impression,
it must superabound in rude vitality, as much
as it is deficient in symmetry and “measure.”
The next step, then as now, might be the preparation
of a form answering in size to that of
the intended figure, but also in wax or clay. In
the final part of the process, however, the distinction
is complete; in the sixteenth century
no way was open to the maker, but himself to
perfect the statue with hammer and chisel. The
advance of mechanical skill has enabled the
modern artist to dispense with this labor. It
may be questioned whether the consequent saving
of pains is in all respects an advantage; at
least, I have the authority of one of the most
accomplished of modern portrait sculptors for
the opinion that in strict propriety every kind of
plastic work ought to receive its final touches
from the hand of the designer. Even if this
were done, the method would not answer to that
of the earlier century, when it was the practice
to cleave away the marble in successive planes,
in such manner as gradually to disengage the
outlines of the image, which thus appeared to
lie veiled beneath the superficies, as an indwelling<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</span>
tenant waiting release from the hand of the
carver. Moreover, the preciousness of the material
had on the fancy a salutary influence; before
beginning his task, the sculptor was compelled
to take into account the possibility of
execution. He would commonly feel himself
obliged to make use of any particular block
of marble which he might have the fortune to
possess; it might even happen that such block
possessed an unusual form, as was the case with
the stone placed at the disposal of Michelangelo,
and from which he created his David.
The test of genius would therefore be the ability,
on perception of the material, to form a
suitable conception; a sculptor, if worthy of
the name, would perceive the possible statue
within the mass. The metaphor, so frequently
and beautifully used by Michelangelo, which
represents the artist as conceiving the dormant
image which his toil must bring forth from its
enveloping stone, is therefore no commonplace
of scholastic philosophy, no empty phrase declaring
that matter potentially contains unnumbered
forms, but a true description of the process
of creative energy. Inasmuch as by an
inevitable animism all conceptions derived
from human activity are imaginatively transferred<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</span>
to external life, the comparison is extended
into the realm of Nature, which by a
highly poetic forecast of the modern doctrine of
evolution is said through the ages to aim at attaining
an ideal excellence. The impulse visible
in the art of the sculptor thus appears in
his poetry, which, also perfected through unwearied
toil, terminates in a result which is truly
organic, and of which all parts seem to derive
from a central idea.</p>

<p>A lyric poet, if he possess genuine talent, is
concerned with the presentation, not of form
or thought, but of emotion. His fancy, therefore,
commonly operates in a manner different
from that of the artist, whose duty it is primarily
to consider the visual image; the verse
of the latter, if he undertakes to express himself
also in the poetic manner, is usually characterized
by a predominance of detail, an overdistinctness
of parts, an inability of condensation,
qualities belonging to an imagination conceiving
of life as definitely formal rather than as
vaguely impressive. On the contrary, Michelangelo
is a true lyrist, whose mental vision is
not too concrete to be also dreamy. This
property is a strange proof of the multiformity
of his genius, for it is the reverse of what one<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</span>
would expect from a contemplation of his
plastic work. The inspiration, though in a
measure biographic, is no mere reflection of
the experience; notwithstanding the sincerity
of the impulse, as should be the case in lyric
verse, the expression transcends to the universal.</p>

<p>It does not detract from his worth as a lyrical
writer, that the range of the themes is narrow,
a limitation sufficiently explained by the
conditions. The particular sentiment for the
expression of which he needed rhyme was sexual
affection. In the verse, if not in the art,
“all thoughts, all passions, all delights” are
ministers of that emotion. Michelangelo is as
much a poet of love as Heine or Shelley.</p>

<p>The sonnets were intended not to be sung,
but to be read; this purpose may account for
occasional deficiencies of music. The beauty
of the idea, the abundance of the thought, the
sincerity of the emotion, cause them to stand
in clear contrast to the productions of contemporary
versifiers.</p>

<p>Less attention has been paid to the madrigals,
on which the author bestowed equal pains.
These are songs, and the melody has affected
the thought. The self-consciousness of the<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</span>
poet is subordinated to the objectivity of the
musician who aims to render human experience
into sweet sound. For the most part,
and with some conspicuous exceptions, even
where the idea is equally mystical, the reasoning
is not so intricate nor the sentiment so
biographic. A certain number have the character
of simple love verse. In these compositions
ardor is unchecked by reflection, and desire
allowed its natural course, unquenched by
the abundant flow of the thought which it has
awakened. What assumes the aspect of love-sorrow
is in reality a joyous current of life
mocking grief with the music of its ripples.
If one desired to name the composer whom
the sentiment suggests, he might mention
Schumann rather than Beethoven.</p>

<p>Other indifferent artists have been excellent
poets, and other tolerable versifiers clever artists;
but only once in human history has coexisted
the highest talent for plastic form and
verbal expression. Had these verses come down
without name, had they been disinterred from
the dust of a library as the legacy of an anonymous
singer, they would be held to confer on
the maker a title to rank among intellectual
benefactors. It would be said that an unknown<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</span>
poet, whose verse proved him also a sculptor,
had contributed to literature thoughts whose
character might be summed up in the lines of
his madrigal:—</p>

<h3>NOTES ON THE SONNETS</h3>

<p><em>The Roman numbers, in the Introduction
and Notes, refer to the numeration of
Guasti (Le Rime di Michelangelo
Buonarroti, Florence, 1863).</em></p>


  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image061b.jpg" alt="(Stylized E)">
<p class="drop-cap">ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS OF THE
POEMS.—On the corrupted texts
of 1623 were based the versions
of J. E. Taylor (Michael Angelo
considered as a Philosophic
Poet. With Translations. London, 1840),
and of J. S. Harford (Life of Michael Angelo
Buonarroti. With Translations of many of
his Poems and Letters. London, 1857). The
beautiful renderings of Wordsworth (five sonnets)
depended on the same faulty presentation.
The correct texts of Guasti were
followed by J. A. Symonds in his complete
translation of the sonnets (The Sonnets of
Michael Angelo Buonarroti and Tommasi
Campanella. London, 1878). In his biography
of the sculptor (The Life of Michael-Angelo
Buonarroti. London, 1893), Symonds
rendered several of the madrigals. A selection<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
from the poems, with the Italian text, and
renderings by different hands, was edited by
Mrs. E. D. Cheney (Selected Poems from
Michael-Angelo Buonarroti. With Translations
from various sources. Boston, 1885).
This publication includes thirteen epitaphs for
Cecchino Bracchi, and the verses written by
Michelangelo on the death of his father, as
well as a number of the sonnets of the last
period (after 1547). Versions of single sonnets
may be found scattered through periodical
literature.</p>


<p>1 [<span class="allsmcap">I</span>] Donato
Giannotti wrote an essay concerning the duration of the journey
through Hell and Purgatory, as related in the “Divina Commedia.”
This discussion he cast into the form of a dialogue, in which
Michelangelo is given the principal part; the conversation is dated
as taking place in 1545, and one of the interlocutors is made to
recite the sonnet which, with doubtful accuracy, is said to have been
composed a few days before. The work of Giannotti is interesting as
containing the estimate of a contemporary concerning the character of
Michelangelo, but the words assigned to him cannot be considered as a
record of his actual expressions. The essayist seems to have applied
to the artist for material, as indicated by the subscription of the
following sonnet, probably composed at this time.</p>

<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<h4 id="NS_II">[II]</h4>

<h5 lang="it">QUANTE DIRNE SI DE’ NON SI PUÒ DIRE</h5>
<div class="note-poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">His praise remains unuttered, for his fire</div>
    <div class="verse">Of glory burneth with o’ervivid flame;</div>
    <div class="verse">The home that wronged him easier to blame,</div>
    <div class="verse">Than toward his humblest merit to aspire.</div>
    <div class="verse">This man for us descended, where God’s ire</div>
    <div class="verse">Subdueth sin, once more toward heaven rose;</div>
    <div class="verse">The gates that his Creator did not close,</div>
    <div class="verse">A cruel city barred to his desire.</div>
    <div class="verse">Ah ruthless mother, nurse of her own woe,</div>
    <div class="verse">In measure as her sons are excellent,</div>
    <div class="verse">Their sorrow making bitterly to flow!</div>

    <div class="verse">No man hath lived more shamefully exiled,</div>
    <div class="verse">No age hath known a like, a greater child.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>2 [<span class="allsmcap">XIV</span>] The
sketch, characterized by rude vigor, lacks the truth and harmony
essential to a beautiful work; these qualities are to be attained
by the final touches of the hammer, or, as we should now say, of
the chisel. So it is only the influence of the beloved person which
can perfect the incomplete design of Nature, and bestow on the
character its final excellence. Of all the sonnets, this is the most
celebrated.</p>

<p>Respecting an inferior variant, the younger Buonarroti, in an
obscure mention, appears to say that it was contained in a letter of
the<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> sculptor written
in 1550, which letter made mention of the marchioness of Pescara; and
this assertion has led Guasti to refer the sonnet to that date. It is
quite clear, however, that the treatment does not belong to the later
period, after the death of Vittoria Colonna, in which the productions
of Michelangelo had assumed the monotone of a colorless piety. It
seems to me more likely that the time of composition is to be set
earlier than 1534, and that the conception, ideal in character, had
no relation to Vittoria, with whom the sculptor had perhaps not yet
become acquainted.</p>


<p>3 [<span class="allsmcap">XV</span>] The
sculptor, who is designated as the best of artists, on beholding the
block of marble at his disposal, obtains the suggestion of a statue;
this possible work appears to him as a figure concealed beneath the
veil of superincumbent matter, which he proceeds to remove. His
success will depend on the clearness of internal vision; if he lack
the vivid conception, the result will be an abortive product, which
metaphorically may be called a likeness of Death. So if the lover,
in place of the “mercy” which he desires to awaken, can create in
the heart of his lady only a feeling inconsistent with his wishes,
the blame should be laid solely to his own insufficiency. The idea
is poetic, not philosophic, and the sonnet a poem of love,<span
class="r_pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> belonging to what I
have called the earlier manner of the poet. The sonnet has been
paraphrased by Emerson:—</p>

<div class="note-poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Never did sculptor’s dream unfold</div>
    <div class="verse">A form which marble doth not hold</div>
    <div class="verse">In its white block; yet it therein shall find</div>
    <div class="verse">Only the hand secure and bold</div>
    <div class="verse">Which still obeys the mind.</div>
    <div class="verse">So hide in thee, thou heavenly dame,</div>
    <div class="verse">The ill I shun, the good I claim;</div>
    <div class="verse">I, alas! not well alive,</div>
    <div class="verse">Miss the aim whereto I strive.</div>
    <div class="verse">Not love, nor beauty’s pride,</div>
    <div class="verse">Nor fortune, nor thy coldness can I chide,</div>
    <div class="verse">If whilst within thy heart abide</div>
    <div class="verse">Both death and pity, my unequal skill</div>
    <div class="verse">Fails of the life, but draws the death and ill.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this rendering the fourth line is open to criticism; it is not
want of manual skill that is the cause of failure, but the inability
to form an adequate idea. Harford modernizes the introductory
lines:—</p>

<div class="note-poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Whate’er conception a great artist fires,</div>
    <div class="verse">Its answering semblance latent lies within</div>
    <div class="verse">A block of marble.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The metaphor is thus reduced to the scholastic platitude, that in
all matter lies the potentiality of form. So Varchi understood<span
class="r_pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> the lines, and cites
Aristotle as authority that the action of an agent is nothing but
the extraction of a thing from potency to act; with changes on such
intolerable jargon he occupies two pages. The lecture, intended to be
flattering, only serves to show with what contemporary crassness the
delicate conceptions of Michelangelo were obliged to struggle.</p>


<p>4 [<span class="allsmcap">XVII</span>] The
contrast between the permanence of the artistic product and the
transitoriness of the mortal subject suggests reflections which may
take different turns. (See madrigal No. 9 [<span class="allsmcap">XIII</span>].) One is reminded of certain
sonnets of Shakespeare.</p>


<p>5 [<span class="allsmcap">XIX</span>] The
lover feels himself enriched by the impression of the beloved, which,
like the divine name on the seal of Solomon, confers the power of
working miracles. The pretty composition is among the few which may
be said to be inspired by a really cheerful and joyous sentiment,
and, like the preceding, may be held to belong to the earlier manner
of the poet.</p>


<p>6 [<span class="allsmcap">XX</span>] This
most beautiful sonnet, somewhat immature in its music, is a precious
relic of Michelangelo’s early love verse. The poem was written
below a letter from his father, received in Bologna, and dated 24
December, 1507. Subscribed is the line: <i lang="it">La m’arde
e lega et emmi e parmi un zucchero</i>.<span class="r_pagenum"
id="Page_67">[67]</span> “She burns me and binds me and eats me, and
I think her a sugarplum.” The lines, therefore, have a biographic
inspiration, and may be presumed to have been in honor of some young
beauty of Bologna. A fragment of a madrigal seems akin.</p>

evidence of belonging to a period relatively
early.</p>

<p>It would seem that these remains of the poetical activity of
early manhood, though not numerous, are yet sufficient to refute
the rash generalizations of biographers who undertake to sum up
the personality from their impressions of the artistic product. It
does seem strange that with these lines before him, Mr. Symonds
could have written: “Michelangelo emerges as a mighty master who
was dominated by the vision of male beauty, and who saw the female
mainly through the fascination of the other sex. The defect of
his<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> art is due to a
certain constitutional callousness, a want of sensuous or imaginative
sensibility for what is specifically feminine.... Michelangelo
neither loved nor admired nor yielded to the female sex.... I
find it difficult to resist the conclusion that Michelangelo felt
himself compelled to treat women as though they were another and
less graceful sort of males. What he did not comprehend and could
not represent was woman in her girlishness, her youthful joy,
her physical attractions, her magic of seduction.... What makes
Michelangelo’s crudity in his plastic treatment of the female form
the more remarkable is that in his poetry he seems to feel the
influence of women mystically. I shall have to discuss this topic
in another place. It is enough here to say that, with very few
exceptions, we remain in doubt whether he is addressing a woman at
all. There are none of those spontaneous utterances by which a man
involuntarily expresses the outgoings of his heart to a beloved
object, the throb of irresistible emotion, the physical ache,
the sense of wanting, the joys and pains, the hopes and fears,
which belong to genuine passion.... Michelangelo’s ‘donna’ might
just as well be a man; and indeed, the poems he addressed to men,
though they have nothing sensual about them, reveal a finer<span
class="r_pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> touch in the emotion of
the writer.” (Life, vol. i, c. vi, 8. See vol. ii, pp. 381-5.)</p>

<p>The reasons for the limitation which may have prevented
Michelangelo from adequately representing the sensuous aspect of
womanhood, should be sought in the character of his plastic genius.
So far as the power of appreciation is concerned, and especially
in regard to the spirit of the verse, the opinion of Mr. Symonds
appears to me to reverse the fact. The nature of the artist may be
pronounced especially sensitive to the physical influence of woman.
If, in the extant poetry, this sentiment appears in chastened form,
such calmness may be set down solely to the period of life. Yet even
in these later compositions, extreme impressibility is revealed in
every line. Mr. Symonds’s error has prevented him from entering
into the spirit of the sonnets, and also constitutes a deficiency
in his instructive biography. (See note to sonnet No. 13 [<span
class="allsmcap">XXX</span>].)</p>


<p>7 [<span class="allsmcap">XXII</span>] The
verse, direct and passionate, though doubtless of a later date, still
bears the character of pieces which must be pronounced relatively
early. Observable is the use of theologic metaphor, employed only
for the sake of poetic coloring, and not yet sublimed to pure
thought.</p>

<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>


<p>8 [<span class="allsmcap">XXIV</span>] This delightful sonnet, according
to the nephew, was found on a letter bearing
date of 1529. (See<a href="#Page_7"> p. 7.</a>) The lines seem to
give the idea of a gentle and lovely personage
whose countenance shines out as through a
golden mist. In later compositions, the conflict
of Death and Love is worked out differently.
(See madrigal No. 9 [<span class="allsmcap">XIII</span>].)</p>


<p>9 [<span class="allsmcap">XXV</span>] On the same authority, this inexpressibly
charming production is assigned to
1529. Here appear the germs of Platonic imagination.
The soul, a divine essence, endows the
visible suggestion with the spiritual essence
derived from its own store. But the object
is not completely divinized; the end is still
possession. The reflective element will increase,
the sensuous lessen, until poetry passes
over into piety.</p>


<p>10 [<span class="allsmcap">XXVII</span>] The love verse is not to be taken
as wholly biographic, but rather as ideal.</p>


<p>11 [<span class="allsmcap">XXVIII</span>] The atmosphere of the sonnet
is that of later time and of a more rarefied
height. We are now in full Platonism. The
soul, heaven-born, perceives in the eyes of the
beloved its primal home, the Paradise whence
itself has descended, and the heavenly affection
of which earthly love is a reminiscence. But
the period may still be before the Roman residence,
and the meeting with Vittoria Colonna.</p>

<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>


<p>12 [<span class="allsmcap">XXIX</span>] This sonnet may safely be set
down as belonging to the later time. The
sentiment of unhappy attachment, impossible
desire, wistful loneliness, breathes through
the verse. The piece contains two mystical
but grand lines. Whoever has hoped for
an elevation not given to mortals has wasted
his thought in the endeavor to penetrate the
recesses of deity, as seed is lost on the stony
ground, and words spent in the limitless air.</p>


<p>13 [<span class="allsmcap">XXX</span>] This gentle and tender poem,
of the earlier period, somewhat similar in
sentiment to No. 5 [<span class="allsmcap">XIX</span>], and obviously
from the heart, is penetrated by the same
feeling as that discernible in Nos. 8 and 9
[<span class="allsmcap">XXIV</span> and <span class="allsmcap">XXV</span>]. Varchi, with his characteristic
want of perception, chose to fancy
that it might be addressed to a man, like the
following, said to be composed for Tommaso
Cavalieri.</p>

</div>

<p>The words <i lang="it">cavalier armato</i> are supposed
to have referred to the aforesaid Cavalieri, a
Roman youth whom Varchi describes as all
that was beautiful and lovable. The highest
male beauty seems to have had for Italians of
the Renaissance, an attraction similar to that
which it possessed for Athenians, a charm
which our modern taste does not entirely comprehend.
Thus the early death of Cecchino
Bracchi had produced a great sensation; the
epitaphs addressed to his memory by Michelangelo,
who had never looked on his face, attest
the sincerity of his own sentiment. For
Cavalieri, whom the artist had known in
1533, he seems to have what can be described
only as a passion; the three extant letters
addressed to the young man breathe that
timidity, sense of inferiority, and fear of misunderstanding
which ordinarily belong only to
sexual attachment. This emotion needs no
apology other than that contained in a letter
to this friend: “And if you are sure of my<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
affection, you ought to think and know that
he who loveth remembereth, and can no more
forget the things he fervently loves, than a
hungry man the food that nourishes him;
nay, much less may one forget beloved objects
than the food on which man liveth; for
they nourish both soul and body, the last with
the greatest sobriety, and the first with tranquil
felicity and the expectation of everlasting
salvation.” (Lettere, No. 4, 16.) The
susceptibility of Michelangelo toward external
impressions is noted by Giannotti, who
makes him affirm that as often as he set
eyes on any person endowed with excellence
he could not help becoming enamored of
him in such manner that he surrendered himself
to him as a prey. (Guasti, Rime, p.
<span class="allsmcap">XXXI</span>.) To the point is Michelangelo’s own
estimate of his character expressed in a sonnet.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It is well to know that Cavalieri seems to
have had a modest and noble nature, and that
his personal attachment and artistic appreciation
soothed the declining days of Michelangelo,
at whose end he was present.</p>

<p>The mention of Michelangelo himself
(Lettere, No. 466; Symonds, Life, vol. ii,
p. 130) seems to prove that this sonnet was
really composed for his young friend. But
it is one thing to conclude that the piece
was addressed to Cavalieri, quite another to
suppose that it was inspired by him. The
ideas are the same as those elsewhere appearing
in reference to women. The composition
does not appear to me one of the most
original, and I should be disposed to regard
it as ordinary love verse, into which, out of
compliment, the writer had introduced the
punning allusion. In any case, it is to be
observed that in the Platonic compositions
treating of male friendship, the whole argument
is metaphorical, the comparisons being<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
borrowed from the earlier poetry of sexual
love.</p>

<p>Fundamental is the question, What proportion
of Michelangelo’s verse was intended
to relate to men, and how far can such verse,
if existent, be taken to imply that he had no
separate way of feeling for women? The
opinions of Mr. Symonds have already been
cited (see note to No. 6 [<span class="allsmcap">XX</span>]). In noticing
Michelangelo’s use of the idiomatic Tuscan
word <i lang="it">signore</i>, lord, as applied in the sonnets
to female persons as well as male (the English
<em>liege</em> may similarly be used), he says,
“But that Michelangelo by the <i lang="it">signore</i> always
or frequently meant a woman can be disproved
in many ways. I will only adduce
the fragment of one sonnet” (No. <span class="allsmcap">LXXXIII</span>).
It is a pity that Mr. Symonds did not enter
into detail; I am quite at a loss for any circumstances
that can be held to warrant his
declaration. For the word, the sonnets only
afford information. No. <span class="allsmcap">XVI</span>, containing the
words <i lang="it">signior mie car</i>, is a variant of No. <span class="allsmcap">XV</span>,
expressly addressed to a lady. In No. <span class="allsmcap">XXII</span>,
no one will doubt that the reference is to a
woman. In No. <span class="allsmcap">XXXV</span> the sex is shown by
the epithet <i lang="it">leggiadre</i>, fair, applied to the arms
(Mr. Symonds renders “fragile”). No.
<span class="allsmcap">XXXVII</span> qualifies <i lang="it">signor</i> by <i lang="it">donna</i>. No. <span class="allsmcap">LV</span>
treats of the shyness of a lady in presence of<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
her lover. In No. <span class="allsmcap">XL</span>, instead of <i lang="it">signior</i>, the
variant gives <i lang="it">donna</i>. No. <span class="allsmcap">XLVII</span> seems obviously
addressed to Vittoria Colonna. In No.
<span class="allsmcap">XXXVI</span>, the feminine application appears to
be indicated by the description of the sovereign
person as reigning <i lang="it">nella casa d’amore</i>.
Thus in not a single instance can the suggestion
of Mr. Symonds be accepted.</p>

<p>There remains the fragment mentioned,
No. <span class="allsmcap">LXXXIII</span>, a beautiful and interesting piece,
unhappily imperfect. “Yonder it was that
Love (<i lang="it">amor</i>; variant, <i lang="it">signior</i>), his mercy, took
my heart, rather my life; here with beauteous
eyes he promised me aid, and with the same
took it away. Yonder he bound me, here he
loosed me; here for myself I wept, and with
infinite grief saw issue from this stone him
who took me from myself, and of me would
none.” It will be seen that the masculine
pronoun is rendered necessary by the reference
to personified Love, and that the allusion is
clearly to sexual passion. Mr. Symonds has
not entirely comprehended the scope of the
fragment. The mystical description of Love
as issuing from a stone (<i lang="it">sasso</i>) may probably
be an application of the familiar sculpturesque
metaphor.</p>

<p>As, in the instances considered, the opinion
of Mr. Symonds appears void of foundation,
so it is counter to the tenor of the poetry.<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
If No. <span class="allsmcap">XXXI</span> really was written for Cavalieri,
the reference probably consisted of no more
than the introduction, into the ordinary
phrases of a love poem, of a complimentary
play on words. As for the metaphor by
which a lady is compared to an armed enemy,
that was already commonplace in the day of
Dante.</p>


<p>14 [<span class="allsmcap">XXXII</span>] From pieces dealing with ideal
affection we pass to one obviously biographic
in its inspiration. The poem is written below
a letter of 1532, addressed to the sculptor
when in Rome. The artist seems to refer
to his own impetuous nature, too liable to
quarrel with friends. Analogous is the sonnet
addressed to Luigi del Riccio. (See madrigal
No. 3 [<span class="allsmcap">IV</span>] note.) But this composition evidently
relates to a lady, as is shown by the
mention of the <i lang="it">dorato strale</i>, gilded dart of
Love.</p>


<p>15 [<span class="allsmcap">XXXIII</span>] As with all lyric poetry, so
in the compositions of Michelangelo, it is
not to be assumed that every expression of
emotion of necessity corresponds to some particular
experience. Yet the tenderness, melancholy,
and gentle regret which inspire the
verse evidently reflect the character and habitual
manner of feeling of the author. Related
in sentiment are the following sonnets:—</p>

<p>16 [<span class="allsmcap">XXXIX</span>] The timid lover, who finds
himself involved in the dangers of a hopeless
passion, endeavors to withdraw from the perilous
situation, but in so doing finds himself
confronted by another danger, that of losing
the affection which has become his life. As
the vain desire will prove the death of the
body, so the renunciation will be that of the
soul; thus the suitor, according to the familiar
metaphorical system furnished by plastic<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
art, is said to see his lady with a statue of
Death on either hand.</p>

<p>The beautiful and mystic sonnet was written
on a stray leaf bearing a memorandum of
1529, and was probably composed in that
year. According to the statement of the
nephew, Nos. 8 and 9 [<span class="allsmcap">XXIV</span> and <span class="allsmcap">XXV</span>] were
also written on letters of that year; and these
two poems correspond in sentiment with the
present piece.</p>


<p>17 [<span class="allsmcap">XL</span>] This most beautiful sonnet might
conjecturally be referred to the same period
as No. 12 [<span class="allsmcap">XXIX</span>]. The spirit of the verse
ought to be enough to satisfy any reader that
it was composed with reference to a woman.
(See note to No. 13 [<span class="allsmcap">XXX</span>].)</p>


<p>18, 19 [<span class="allsmcap">XLIII</span>, <span class="allsmcap">XLIV</span>] These two pieces,
containing respectively the dispraise and praise
of night, are obviously intended to be counterparts,
the first forming an introduction to the
second. The consolations belonging to darkness
and slumber have furnished themes to
very many writers of verse; but among all
such pieces Michelangelo’s tribute is entitled
to preëminence. The emotion, deepening
with the progress of the rhyme, ends in one
of those outbursts which make the poetry a
key to the character. Two other sonnets
treating of the same subject do not appear to
be connected.</p>

<p>In No. <span class="allsmcap">XLII</span> Night is lauded, as the shadow

sweetness and sublimity of No. <span class="allsmcap">XLIV</span>.</p>


<p>20 [<span class="allsmcap">LII</span>] This fine sonnet, belonging to
the later period, may be set down as among
those inspired by Vittoria Colonna. Thoroughly
characteristic is the grand fifth line,
in which the soul is said to have been created
as God’s equal. The nephew, of course,
diluted such daring conceptions into commonplace,<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
and his restoration altogether fails to
convey the essential meaning of the piece.
Wordsworth, unfortunately, knew only the
emasculated version.</p>

<p>Similar in theme is another sonnet, No. <span class="allsmcap">LX</span>,
also rendered by Wordsworth, from a text
more nearly representative. In this instance
the English poet has transcended his source,
and furnished a proof that on fortunate occasions
a translation may belong to the very
best poetry, and deserve that immortality
which commonly belongs only to expressions
of original genius.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<p>21 [<span class="allsmcap">LVI</span>] The sonnet is to be classed with
the preceding. In a variant, the theologic
metaphor is carried further: “From without,
I know not whence, came that immortal part
which separateth not from thy sacred breast,
yet traverseth the entire world, healeth every
intellect, and honoreth heaven.”</p>


<p>22 [<span class="allsmcap">LXI</span>] As all tools used by man are
formed by means of other tools, the archetypal
tool must be that celestial instrument by which
the world is fashioned. On earth, Vittoria
Colonna had been the hammer (as we now
say, the chisel) by which had been inspired
the creative activity of the artist. By her
death, this influence had been withdrawn to
heaven, there to become united with the all-forming
hammer of the eternal Maker; it is,
therefore, only from on high that the artist
can look for the completion of his own
genius.</p>

<p>To the text, in the hand of Michelangelo,
is added a sentence expressing his sense of
the incomparable merit of Vittoria, as the
divine instrument which none other is able
to wield, and a prayer that his own hammer,
as he metaphorically says, may also attain a
reception in heaven.</p>

<p>The mystically expressed, but in reality
simple and direct verse is crowded with ideas
which strive for utterance. The sculptor<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
seems to have written prophetically; after the
passing away of Vittoria, the last of his animating
impulses appears to have been removed,
and his life becomes that of a recluse, struggling
with the infirmities of advancing age.</p>

<p>Several other pieces relate to the death of
Vittoria.</p>

the loss of its best creation, is repeated in
Michelangelo’s poetry. (See sonnet No. 4
[<span class="allsmcap">XVII</span>], madrigal No. 9 [<span class="allsmcap">XIII</span>].)</p>

<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>Two other sonnets, Nos. <span class="allsmcap">LXIII</span> and <span class="allsmcap">LXIV</span>,
breathe an atmosphere of the most gloomy
despair. The first expresses a profound self-reproach;
the time to soar heavenward was
while the sun of life still shone; it is now
too late. The second declares that the flame
has expired, to leave only ashes without a
spark.</p>

<p>I do not doubt that here also belongs another
sonnet, placed by Guasti as if belonging
to an earlier date.</p>

on Cecchino Bracci, in 1544. Mr. Symonds
very unjustly criticises the verse as constrained,
affected, and exhibiting an absence of genuine
grief.</p>

<p>1 [<span class="allsmcap">I</span>] <span class="allsmcap">THE NIGHT OF THE MEDICI CHAPEL.</span>
According to Vasari, when the statues of the
Medici Chapel were exposed to view, after
Michelangelo’s departure for Rome, early in
1535, an unknown author affixed a quatrain
to the image of Night. This person was
afterwards known as Giovanni di Carlo
Strozzi, at the time eighteen years of age.
The verse, not ungraceful but superficial,
recited that Night, carved by an angel, was
living, for the very reason that she seemed
to sleep, and if accosted, would make reply.
To this fanciful compliment, Michelangelo
responded in the beautiful quatrain, which
exhibits his view of the Medicean usurpation.</p>

<p>It were to be wished that in presence of
the awful forms, visitors would bear in mind
the sculptor’s advice. I have heard a young
American lady, in a voice somewhat strident,
expound to her mother the theme of the
statue, reading aloud the information furnished
by Baedeker.</p>


<p>2 [<span class="allsmcap">II</span>] <span class="allsmcap">DEATH AND THE COFFIN.</span> The
younger Buonarroti cites the statement of
Bernardo Buontalenti, that in his house in
Rome, halfway up the stair, Michelangelo<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
had drawn a skeleton Death carrying on his
shoulder a coffin, on which were inscribed
these lines. The story is interesting, in connection
with the part taken by Death in the
verse of the sculptor. <ins class="corr" id="Gen" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Gianotti">Giannotti</ins> represents
him as declining to attend a merry-making
on the ground that it was necessary to muse
on Death. (See madrigal No. 12 [<span class="allsmcap">XVI</span>].)
The idea appears to be that death cannot
be dreadful, since it bequeaths to life not only
the immortal soul, but even the body; probably
the artist meant to say the body made
immortal through art.</p>


<p>3 [<span class="allsmcap">V</span>] <span class="allsmcap">DEFINITION OF LOVE.</span> With this
definition from the subjective point of view,
may be compared madrigal No. 5 [<span class="allsmcap">VIII</span>].
As usual the imagination of the poet takes
plastic form; Love, in his mind, is a statue
lying in the heart, and waiting to be unveiled.
Akin is the celebrated sonnet of
Dante, <i lang="it">Amor e cor gentil sono una cosa</i>, which
contains the same conception, and which
perhaps Michelangelo may have remembered.
But the more mystical idea of the sculptor
borrows only the suggestion.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="MADRIGAL_NOTES">NOTES ON THE
MADRIGALS</h3>
</div>


<p>1 [<span class="allsmcap">I</span>] During his Roman residence, Michelangelo
was brought into intimate relations
with Florentine exiles, who gathered in
Rome, where ruled a Farnese pope, and
where certain cardinals favored the anti-Medicean
faction. From the course of a
turbulent mountain-brook, Florence, following
an inevitable law, was obliged to issue
into the quiet but lifeless flow of inevitable
despotism. It could not be expected that
the fiery Michelangelo could comprehend the
inexorableness of the fate which, in consequence
of the necessities of trade, compelled
Florence to prefer conditions ensuring tranquillity,
though under an inglorious and corrupt
personal rule. The sublime madrigal
shows the depth of his republican sentiments.
(See No. 22 [<span class="allsmcap">LXVIII</span>].)</p>


<p>2 [<span class="allsmcap">III</span>] The difficult but very interesting
madrigal gives a profound insight into the
spirit of the writer, who felt himself to move
in a society foreign from the higher flight of
his genius. His habits of isolation are remarked
by contemporaries. Giannotti, in
the dialogue above mentioned, discourses
amusingly on this trait of character, putting<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
into the mouth of the artist a reply to an invitation.
“I won’t promise.” “Why?”
“Because I had rather stay at home.” “For
what reason?” “Because, if I should put
myself under such conditions, I should be
too gay; and I don’t want to be gay.”
Luigi del Riccio, introduced as interlocutor,
exclaims that he never heard of such a thing;
in this sad world one must seize every opportunity
of distraction; he himself would supply
a monochord, and they would all dance, to
drive away sorrow. To this comforting proposition,
Michelangelo returns that he should
much prefer to cry. Giannotti romances;
but Francis of Holland is nearer the fact
when he makes the sculptor answer an accusation
urged against solitary habits. The
artist declares that there is good ground for
such accusation against one who withdraws
from the world by reason of eccentricity, but
not against a man who has something better to
do with his time. The particular occasion of
the madrigal seems to have been dissatisfaction
with praise lavished on what to Michelangelo
seemed an unworthy work. Southey
paraphrases the poem, but gives the idea only
imperfectly.</p>

<p>Here, in connection with the idea of beauty
as furnished from within, may be introduced
a version of a madrigal interesting rather on<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
account of the philosophic conception than
the poetic excellence. (See also sonnet <span class="allsmcap">XVIII</span>,
translated in the note to No. <span class="allsmcap">XXX</span>.)</p>

    <div class="verse">They linger, unless mercy call them thence.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>3 [<span class="allsmcap">IV</span>] The madrigal is addressed to Luigi
del Riccio, friend of Michelangelo’s declining
years, and a correspondent to whom were
transmitted many of the extant poems. In
1544 Luigi, during a sickness of the sculptor,
took him into his own house and acted as his
nurse; but shortly afterwards, he refused a
request of the artist, declining to suppress an
engraving he had been requested to destroy.<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
The indignation of Michelangelo found vent
in a bitter letter. Riccio died in 1546. Symonds
(Life, vol. ii, p. 194) thinks that
Michelangelo speedily excused his friend and
repented his anger. Here the whole heart of
the artist is disclosed, and we have a revelation
of the manner in which internal brooding
and many disappointments had rendered somewhat
morose a gentle and affectionate nature,
characterized by pride amounting to a fault.</p>

<p>With the idea may be compared Emerson’s
essay on “Gifts.” “Hence the fitness of
beautiful, not useful things, for gifts. This
giving is usurpation, and therefore, when the
beneficiary is ungrateful, as all beneficiaries
hate all Timons, not at all considering the
value of the gift, but looking back to the
greater store it was taken from, I rather sympathize
with the beneficiary than with the
anger of my lord Timon. For the expectation
of gratitude is mean, and is continually
punished by the total insensibility of the
obliged person. It is great happiness to get
off without injury and heart-burning from
one who has had the ill-luck to be served by
you. It is a very onerous business, this of
being served, and the debtor naturally wishes
to give you a slap.” He adds, entirely in
the spirit of Michelangelo, “No services are
of any value, but only likeness.”</p>

<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span></p>


<p>4 [<span class="allsmcap">V</span>] The poet addresses to his friend
Vittoria Colonna a theologic inquiry, after
the manner of the appeals of Dante to Beatrice.
Apparently the letter included a blank
leaf for an answer. The question is, “In
heaven are contrite sinners less valued than
self-satisfied saints?” The obvious reply
must be that in the nature of things such
saints are impossible. The inquiry, therefore,
is not to be taken as serious, but as
playful and ironical. I should be inclined to
interpret the verse as asking, “Am I, an
humble artist, but sincerely devoted, of less
value in your eyes than the very courtly and
important personages by whom you are surrounded?”
(as Vittoria was in close intimacy
with high ecclesiastical functionaries). The
sentiment is gay and jesting, while full of
pleading affection.</p>


<p>5 [<span class="allsmcap">VIII</span>] If of all the compositions of Michelangelo,
one were asked to name the most
representative, it would be natural to select
this incomparably lovely madrigal. No lyric
poet has brought into a few words more
music, more truth, more illumination. The
four lines cited at the end of the Introduction
might well be taken as the motto for a gathering
of the poems; and if the arrangement
had not seemed inconsistent with the numbering
of the pieces, I would gladly have placed<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the madrigal at the end, as summing up the especial
contribution of Michelangelo to letters.</p>


<p>6 [<span class="allsmcap">IX</span>] A charming and light-hearted piece
of music, obviously belonging to the earlier
period of Michelangelo’s poetic activity. The
verse is written on blue paper, with the subscription,
“Divine things are spoken of in an
azure field” (in heaven). The suggestion is
furnished by a conventional <i lang="it">concetto</i> of the
period; but the familiarity does not prevent
the thought lending itself to genuinely poetical
treatment. No. <span class="allsmcap">X</span> is a pretty variant,
in which the cruelty of the lady is compared
to the hardness of the marble in which her
image is wrought. The lines are subscribed
“for sculptors” (<i lang="it">Da scultori</i>). The close
connection with his art lends to even the
most simple of these verses an unspeakable
attraction.</p>


<p>7 [<span class="allsmcap">XI</span>] In this magnificent song, worthy
of the greatest of lyric poets, we are still occupied
with the concepts of plastic art. The
artist achieves the complete expression of his
idea only through painful toil, and often lapse
of years which leave him ready to depart from
a world in which accomplishment is itself a
sign of ripeness for death. With that universal
animism, as we now say, by which all
general truths of man’s life are felt to be also
applicable to the course of Nature, the poet<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
is entitled to apply the idea to external being.
And with what insight! If ever genius can
be said to have forecast the conclusions of
scientific inquiry, it is so in this instance;
Michelangelo presents us with a truly modern
conception of Nature, as the creative artist,
who through a series of ages and a succession
of sketches, is occupied with continually unsuccessful,
but ever-improving efforts at the
expression of her internal life. The perfection
of the creature, which marks the accomplishment
of the undertaking, signifies also the
end of the process; with such completeness
is felt the sorrow incident to all termination,
and especially the pain of the mortal, who
feels that delight in perfect beauty enforces
the consciousness of his own transitoriness,
and emphasizes the sense of Nature as perishable.
Hence, perhaps it may be explained
that all perception of perfect loveliness is said
to be accompanied by a sensation of fear.
The piece possesses a grandeur of rhythm
corresponding to its depth of intellectual apprehension,
and is worthy to stand beside the
greatest of the artist’s plastic productions, as
equally immortal. In such verse Michelangelo
rose to the level of a world poet; nor
has early English literature anything of a kindred
nature worthy to be placed in comparison.</p>


<p>8 [<span class="allsmcap">XII</span>] Michelangelo perpetually varies<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
but never repeats the theme. Once more, it
is not the trembling of the hand which causes
the artist’s failure; it is the uncertainty of the
mind, not clear as to its intent.</p>


<p>9 [<span class="allsmcap">XIII</span>] Again the bitter contrast of the
permanence of art with the fleeting period of
human life. We have had the idea in sonnet
<span class="allsmcap">XVII</span>. But the argument is now carried a step
further. According to mediæval (and also
modern) national morality, the destruction of
kindred implies the duty of blood-vengeance.
On whom, then, devolves the conduct of the
feud made necessary by the taking away of
the beloved? Not on man, but on Nature,
whose pride must be offended by the preference
given to the works of her children as
compared with the transitoriness of her own.
The permanence of the artistic product is
therefore a sign that Nature herself is bound
to require of Time atonement for the wrong
done to imagination; and thus art is made
the prophet of restoration.</p>


<p>10 [<span class="allsmcap">XIV</span>] The metaphor is now furnished
by the work of the metal-caster; and since
in this case there has been no change in the
conditions of manufacture, the comparison
still seems simple and natural.</p>


<p>11 [<span class="allsmcap">XV</span>] The tender, simple, and universally
applicable lament at the same time includes
its own consolation.</p>

<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>


<p>12 [<span class="allsmcap">XVI</span>] The idea of Death as deliverer
from Love is often repeated by the poet.
Giannotti probably followed rather the verse
than any spoken words in the sentences he
has put into the lips of the artist: “I remind
you that to re-discover one’s self, and to
enjoy one’s self, it is not necessary to seize
on so many pleasures and delights, but only to
reflect on death. This is the only thought
which enables us to recognize ourselves,
which maintains us in unity with ourselves,
and prevents us from being robbed by parents,
kinsfolk, friends, great masters, ambition, avarice,
and other vices and sins, which take man
from man, and keep him dispersed and dissipated,
without suffering him ever to find himself
and become at one with himself. Marvellous
is the effect of this thought of death,
which in virtue of its nature all-destructive,
nevertheless conserves and supports those who
include it in their meditation, and defends
them from every human passion. Which,
methinks, I have sufficiently indicated in a
madrigal, where, in treating of love, I conclude
that against it is no better defence than
the thought of death.”</p>

<p>A beautiful variation, characterized by the
author’s invariable originality, is furnished by
the number next in Guasti’s edition.</p>

<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

    <div class="verse">With arid bough more ardent grows the fire.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>13 [<span class="allsmcap">XVIII</span>] The idea that only through
contemplating the person of the beloved can
the soul transcend from time to eternity is
familiar in the later compositions of Michelangelo.
Compare sonnet 21 [<span class="allsmcap">LVI</span>].</p>


<p>14 [<span class="allsmcap">XIX</span>] The same conception receives
a different treatment; mortal beauty is now
represented as exercising too potent an attraction,
and preventing the desire from mounting
beyond it.</p>


<p>15 [<span class="allsmcap">XXI</span>] The thought has been elaborated
in a modern sense by Lowell in his
“Endymion:”—</p>

<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>

<div class="note-poetry-container">

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Goddess triform, I own thy triple spell,</div>
    <div class="verse">My heaven’s queen,—queen, too, of my earth and hell!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such could not be the termination of the
author of the Renaissance, at a time when his
star was Vittoria Colonna.</p>


<p>16 [<span class="allsmcap">XXIII</span>] The sweet and plaintive verse
was popular as a song even in the lifetime of
Michelangelo, as may be inferred from its
mention by Varchi.</p>


<p>17 [<span class="allsmcap">XXV</span>] The madrigal has all the spirit
of English song in the early part of the seventeenth
century; but what English verse,
having the same idea, could be mentioned in
comparison?</p>

<p><span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>


<p>18 [<span class="allsmcap">LII</span>] The beautiful song exhibits a
great number of variations. Perhaps on account
of the musical character, counteracting
a meditative tendency, Platonic philosophy
appears only as lending a gentle mist transformed
by the sunshine of pleasurable passion.</p>


<p>19 [<span class="allsmcap">LIII</span>] Compare No. <span class="allsmcap">LXXII</span>. I should
assign this madrigal, in spite of its light
character, to the later epoch.</p>


<p>20 [<span class="allsmcap">LIV</span>] The ninth line appears to contain
a reference to Vittoria Colonna, who
lived in a convent, toward which the desires
of the poet, as he says, scarce dared to reach.</p>


<p>21 [<span class="allsmcap">LVII</span>] It can scarce be doubted that
the attribution of masculine thought to the
beloved is a reference to the character of
Vittoria.</p>


<p>22 [<span class="allsmcap">LXVIII</span>] The dialogue of this madrigal
is intentionally veiled, as if the poet were
conscious of dealing with a dangerous theme.
Sublime are the last two lines, containing all
the Michelangelo of the Sistine frescoes; the
sentiment is not the purely Christian conception
of forgiveness of injuries, the mildness
which on principle turns the other cheek.
Significant is the word <i lang="it">altero</i>, haughty; Michelangelo
describes the sentiment of a great
and proud spirit, so lofty as to feel a superiority
to personal resentment, so truly Florentine<span class="r_pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
as to receive no satisfaction in the
prospect of vengeance taken on a citizen of
Florence.</p>


<p>23 [<span class="allsmcap">LXIX</span>] A pretty piece of poetic ratiocination,
cast into the form of a case tried
before a court of love, and ending, in the
spirit of the poet, with a universal truth.</p>


<p>24 [<span class="allsmcap">LXXII</span>] Compare No. 20 [<span class="allsmcap">LIV</span>]. It
will be seen that the allusions give some reason
to believe that the idea is intended to be
biographic, though of course not to be taken
as entirely literal.</p>


<p>25 [<span class="allsmcap">XCIII</span>] A pleasing way of expressing
a sense of the incompatibility of Love and
Death, that appears in many variations, and
must be considered biographic in its sentiment.</p>

<strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong><br>
<br>
Translations were originally presented on opposing pages from the original. For
ease of the reader, they are instead presented here side by side. <br>
<br>
The Notes and Index use the numbering system of Guasti, which is not the same
numbering system used in the translations. Attempting to link the notes
to translations would be prone to error, no such attempt has been made.<br>
<br>
The index was not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page
references.<br>
<br>
Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,
and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.<br>
<br>
Pg <a href="#tue">10</a>: “tuo” replaced with “tue”<br>
Pg <a href="#Gen">90</a>: “Gianotti” replaced with “Giannotti”<br>
